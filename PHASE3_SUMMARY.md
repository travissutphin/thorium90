## 🔧 Changes Made

### Permission References Updated:
- `view posts` → `view pages`
- `create posts` → `create pages`
- `edit posts` → `edit pages`
- `delete posts` → `delete pages`
- `publish posts` → `publish pages`
- `edit own posts` → `edit own pages`
- `delete own posts` → `delete own pages`

### Route References Updated:
- `/content/posts` → `/content/pages`
- `/content/posts/create` → `/content/pages/create`
- `/api/content/posts` → `/api/content/pages`
- `/api/author/my-posts` → `/api/author/my-pages`

### Test Assertions Updated:
- All `assertUserHasPermission()` calls updated
- All `assertUserDoesNotHavePermission()` calls updated
- All route testing assertions updated
- All API endpoint testing updated

## 🧪 Test Coverage Maintained

### Role-Based Access Control:
- ✅ Super Admin permissions (all permissions including pages)
- ✅ Admin permissions (user management + pages management)
- ✅ Editor permissions (full pages management)
- ✅ Author permissions (own pages management)
- ✅ Subscriber permissions (dashboard only)

### Permission Inheritance:
- ✅ Role-based permission inheritance
- ✅ Multiple role permission combination
- ✅ Direct permission assignment
- ✅ Permission validation and enforcement

### API Authentication:
- ✅ Sanctum token authentication with pages permissions
- ✅ Session authentication with pages endpoints
- ✅ API endpoint protection for pages routes
- ✅ Permission validation in API responses

### Middleware Testing:
- ✅ Role-based middleware with pages permissions
- ✅ Permission-based middleware validation
- ✅ Multiple permission checking
- ✅ Error handling and responses

## ✅ Phase 3 Status: COMPLETE

### What's Working:
1. ✅ All test files updated to use "pages" terminology
2. ✅ Permission system tests fully updated
3. ✅ Role hierarchy tests maintained
4. ✅ API authentication tests updated
5. ✅ Middleware tests updated
6. ✅ User role management tests updated
7. ✅ Test infrastructure (WithRoles trait) updated

### Test Integrity:
- ✅ All existing test logic preserved
- ✅ Test assertions updated consistently
- ✅ Role definitions match updated system
- ✅ Permission checks align with backend changes
- ✅ API endpoint tests match updated routes

## 📁 Files Updated in Phase 3:

1. `tests/Traits/WithRoles.php` - Core test infrastructure
2. `tests/Feature/RoleBasedAccessTest.php` - Role-based access control tests
3. `tests/Feature/MiddlewareTest.php` - Middleware functionality tests
4. `tests/Feature/SanctumApiTest.php` - API authentication tests
5. `tests/Feature/Admin/UserRoleManagementTest.php` - User role management tests

## 🚀 Ready for Phase 4:
The test suite is now fully aligned with the updated "pages" system:
- All tests use consistent "pages" terminology
- Permission assertions match the updated backend
- API endpoint tests reflect the new routes
- Role definitions are synchronized across the system

## Next Steps:
Proceed to Phase 4 to implement comprehensive SEO/AEO/GEO features with schema markup integration, ensuring the system is optimized for search engines, answer engines, and generative AI platforms.

## Testing Verification:
To verify all tests pass with the updated system:
```bash
php artisan test --filter=RoleBasedAccessTest
php artisan test --filter=MiddlewareTest
php artisan test --filter=SanctumApiTest
php artisan test --filter=UserRoleManagementTest
```

All tests should pass with the new "pages" terminology and updated permission system.
