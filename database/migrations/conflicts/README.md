# Migration Conflicts - Resolved Automatically

These migrations were moved here to resolve conflicts during deployment.

## What Happened

Thorium90 uses enhanced migrations that replace the standard Laravel base migrations.
These old migrations were conflicting with the enhanced versions and have been moved here.

## Conflicts Resolved

- `2014_10_12_000000_create_users_table.php` → Now using enhanced `0001_01_01_000000_create_users_table.php`
- `2014_10_12_100000_create_password_reset_tokens_table.php` → Now using enhanced `0001_01_01_000001_create_cache_table.php`

## Safe to Delete

These files are safe to delete as their functionality is included in the enhanced migrations.
They are kept here temporarily for reference during the deployment process.
