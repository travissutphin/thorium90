# Developer Onboarding Checklist

## ðŸš¨ **MANDATORY: Development Workflow Completion Required**

**BEFORE writing ANY code or contributing to the project, you MUST complete the [Development Workflow](wiki/Development-Workflow.md) consistency check.**

## ðŸ“‹ **Onboarding Checklist**

### **Phase 1: System Understanding (REQUIRED - 30 minutes)**

#### **1.1 Complete Development Workflow (25 minutes)**
- [ ] **Documentation Review** (5 minutes) - Read system overview and technical patterns
- [ ] **Code Pattern Analysis** (10 minutes) - Examine existing code for patterns
- [ ] **Permission & Role Analysis** (5 minutes) - Check existing permissions and roles
- [ ] **Database Schema Review** (5 minutes) - Understand data relationships
- [ ] **Consistency Validation** (5 minutes) - Verify alignment with existing standards

**If any boxes are unchecked, complete the [Development Workflow](wiki/Development-Workflow.md) first.**

#### **1.2 System Overview (5 minutes)**
- [ ] Read [wiki/Home.md](wiki/Home.md) - System goals and architecture
- [ ] Understand the Multi-Role User Authentication System purpose
- [ ] Familiarize with the technology stack (Laravel + React + Inertia.js)
- [ ] Review the 5 user roles and permission system

### **Phase 2: Technical Deep Dive (REQUIRED - 20 minutes)**

#### **2.1 Architecture Understanding (10 minutes)**

#### **2.2 Code Patterns (10 minutes)**
- [ ] Review existing controllers in `app/Http/Controllers/`
- [ ] Examine model relationships in `app/Models/`
- [ ] Study React components in `resources/js/components/`
- [ ] Review testing patterns in `tests/Feature/`

### **Phase 3: Development Setup (REQUIRED - 15 minutes)**

#### **3.1 Environment Setup (10 minutes)**
- [ ] Clone the repository
- [ ] Install dependencies (`composer install && npm install`)
- [ ] Configure environment (`.env` file)
- [ ] Set up database and run migrations
- [ ] Start development servers

#### **3.2 Testing Setup (5 minutes)**
- [ ] Run the regression test suite (`./regression-test.sh`)
- [ ] Verify all tests pass
- [ ] Understand the testing workflow and patterns

### **Phase 4: First Contribution (REQUIRED - 30 minutes)**

#### **4.1 Feature Planning (15 minutes)**
- [ ] Use the [Task Request Template](wiki/Development-Workflow.md#task-request-template)
- [ ] Complete the consistency check for your feature
- [ ] Plan the implementation following existing patterns
- [ ] Identify required permissions and roles

#### **4.2 Implementation (15 minutes)**
- [ ] Create a feature branch
- [ ] Implement following established patterns
- [ ] Include proper authorization and testing
- [ ] Update relevant documentation

## ðŸš¨ **Enforcement Mechanisms**

### **Code Review Requirements**
- [ ] Development Workflow completion verified
- [ ] Consistency check completed
- [ ] All required documentation updated
