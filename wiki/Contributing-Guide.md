namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use App\Models\User;
use Illuminate\Http\Request;
use Illuminate\Http\JsonResponse;

class UserController extends Controller
{
    /**
     * Display a listing of users.
     *
     * @param Request $request
     * @return JsonResponse
     */
    public function index(Request $request): JsonResponse

import { usePage } from '@inertiajs/react';

interface User {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  email: string;
  roles: string[];
}

export default function UserList(): JSX.Element {
  const [users, setUsers] = useState<User[]>([]);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    // Fetch users
  }, []);
  
  return (
    <div className="user-list">
      {users.map((user) => (
